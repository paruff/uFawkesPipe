description: Monthly DORA metrics snapshot from uFawkesObs, with anomaly flags and a post-release tracking issue
agent: operator
---
# Measure

> **Invoke:** Monthly schedule OR after a significant release OR when measure issue filed by release agent.
> **DORA:** AI Capability 2: Healthy data ecosystems + AI Capability 7: Quality internal platforms
> **Token cost:** Medium (queries external Prometheus/Loki endpoints)
> **Output:** `dora-snapshot-YYYY-MM.json` + `dora-snapshot-YYYY-MM.md`

## Purpose

Translate platform activity into DORA delivery metrics and ROI signal. Ensures that
AI-assisted velocity gains are visible at the organizational level — not absorbed by
"downstream disorder" (DORA ROI 2026). Feeds the `learn` skill when anomalies are
detected, and `@planner` when capability gaps are identified.

This agent runs on a schedule. It does not wait to be asked. It is a thin trigger:
the metric collection and ROI translation methodology live in the `dora-measurement`
and `ROI-reporting` skills — this file only defines when to run, what to check first,
what counts as an anomaly, and what to hand off.

## Trigger Conditions

| Trigger               | Frequency                 | Source                                                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Monthly cadence       | 1st of each month         | Scheduled (cron or manual)                               |
| Post-release          | After each GitHub Release | Filed by release agent (issue label: `dora-measurement`) |
| Anomaly investigation | Ad hoc                    | Filed by the `learn` skill or human observation            |

## Pre-conditions

- [ ] Load `dora-measurement` skill: `"load dora-measurement skill"`
- [ ] Load `ROI-reporting` skill: `"load roi-reporting skill"`
- [ ] uFawkesObs is running: `curl -s http://localhost:9090/-/healthy` returns `OK`
- [ ] Prometheus retention covers the measurement window (default: 30 days)
- [ ] Loki is running and log ingestion is current
- [ ] `GRAFANA_URL`, `PROMETHEUS_URL`, `LOKI_URL` environment variables set
- [ ] Previous snapshot exists for trend comparison (warn if not — first run)

## Responsibilities

### Phase 1 — Collect and translate (delegate to skills)

Follow the `dora-measurement` skill to compute the four DORA delivery metrics
(Deployment Frequency, Lead Time for Changes, Change Failure Rate, Time to Restore)
over the measurement window, using its Prometheus/Loki queries and proxy-metric
fallback. Do not invent data — if `dora-measurement` flags `proxy_metrics: true`,
carry that flag through unchanged.

Then follow the `ROI-reporting` skill to translate the resulting snapshot into the
five-dimension ROI framework (cost efficiency, productivity, developer experience,
user experience, business growth), expressed in plain language.

### Phase 2 — Compare and flag anomalies (agent-specific — not in either skill)

Compare the current snapshot to:

1. Previous monthly snapshot (trend)
2. DORA industry benchmarks (Elite / High / Medium / Low from dora.dev/research)
3. The target set in the discovery-brief.md for the most recent release

Flag any metric that regressed >10% month-over-month OR is in "Low" tier.
Each flag becomes a `learn` skill input.

### Phase 3 — Produce outputs and hand off

Write `dora-snapshot-YYYY-MM.json` and `dora-snapshot-YYYY-MM.md` per the
`dora-measurement` skill's output format, extended with this agent's own
`anomalies` / `learn_agent_input` / `plan_agent_issues` fields (see Output Format
below — these fields are unique to this agent and not part of the skill's contract).
File GitHub issues for any anomaly flags (label: `dora-regression`).
Pass improvement items to `@planner` (label: `capability-improvement`).

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All four DORA metrics computed (or proxy flag set) — via `dora-measurement` skill
- [ ] ROI dimensions populated in plain language — via `ROI-reporting` skill
- [ ] Trend vs. previous snapshot computed
- [ ] DORA tier assessed for each metric
- [ ] Anomalies flagged as GitHub issues
- [ ] Snapshot files written to repo (e.g., `metrics/dora-snapshot-YYYY-MM.json`)
- [ ] `learn` skill notified of anomalies (if any)
- [ ] `@planner` issues filed for capability gaps (if any)
